        Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialized in parts in the American
        journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia
        Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. It is considered one of the most important works of modernist
        literature[1] and has been called "a demonstration and summation of the entire movement."[2] According to Declan
        Kiberd, "Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking".[3]

        The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island,
        near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious
        millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.
        The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties
        he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a
        rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise
        the work over the following winter.

        The Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway's most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and
        power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal â€” a relentless,
        agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly
        contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss.
        Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and
        played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.</div>
