                Barbecue or barbeque (informally BBQ in the UK and US, barbie in Australia and braai in South Africa) is
                a term used with significant regional and national variations to describe various cooking methods which
                use live fire and smoke to cook the food.[1] The term is also generally applied to the devices
                associated with those methods, the broader cuisines that these methods produce, and the meals or
                gatherings at which this style of food is cooked and served. The cooking methods associated with
                barbecuing vary significantly but most involve outdoor cooking

            <p>Kerala beef fry is a dish made of beef, slow-roasted in a mixture of spices, onions, curry leaves, and
                coconut slivers, fried in coconut oil. The dish is also popularly known in Kerala as "Beef
                Ullarthiyathu" The dishes origins can be traced back to AD 52, after which Syrian Christians have been
                known to have settled in Kerala, however the first Jewish settlers arrived in Kerala as early as 6th
                century BC, and brought with them Kosher cattle slaughter techniques, which could have also led to the
                development of the recipe.</p><br>

            <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more
                cooked patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty
                may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce,
                tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a
                "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed
                buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p><br>

            <h1 id="h2">Kerala Fish Curry</h1>
            <p>Fish curry was invented in Singapore when a chef from the state of Kerala named M.J. Gomez, who was
                living in the country, wanted to bring South Indian cuisine to local diners. He started a restaurant
                called Gomez Curry, which was located at Sophia Road and eventually at 9 Selegie Road, both located
                within the Rochor district in the Central Region.[1]
                Although fish head was not widely served in the Indian subcontinent, Chinese customers considered Fish
                head casserole as a special delicacy, and so Gomez had the idea of cooking the fish in curry instead, as
                well as his own ingredients, therefore formulating a new dish

            <p>A fish fry is a meal containing battered or breaded fried fish. It usually also includes french fries,
                coleslaw, hushpuppies, lemon slices, tartar sauce, hot sauce, malt vinegar and dessert. Some Native
                American versions are cooked by coating fish with semolina and egg yolk.
                Fish is often served on Friday nights during Lent, the Christian season of repentance, as a restaurant
                special or through church fundraisers.[1] A fish fry may include potato pancakes (with accompanying side
                dishes of sour cream or applesauce) and sliced caraway rye bread if served in a German restaurant or
                area.

            <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually
                round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
                ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked
                at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a
                pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
                In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten
                with the use of a knife and fork.

            <p>or Porotta is a Subcontinental layered flatbread made from Maida or Atta, alternatively known as flaky
                ribbon pancake. It is very common in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and widely available in other states like
                Karnataka, Maharashtra and countries like Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka. In Tamilnadu we
                have another variant of parotta called as kothu parotta, here kothu is a pure thamizh word meaning to
                shred to pieces, here the chef completely shred the parotta into very tiny pieces and mix it with
                shredded egg fry and mix them and serve them which again is very very tasty. </p><br>

            <h1 id="h2">Puttu</h1>
            <p>Puttu is made by slowly adding water to ground rice until the correct texture is achieved. Using hot
                water would improve the softness of puttu. It is then spiced, formed and steamed with layers of grated
                coconut.The lower section holds water and the upper section holds the puttu, where the rice mixture is
                inserted with layers of grated
                coconut. Perforated lids separate the sections to allow the steam to pass between them.A number of
                alternative cooking vessels are used, such as traditional vessels where a perforated coconut
                shell is attached to a section of bamboo, or a chiratta puttu made of a coconut shell or of metal shaped
                similarly to a coconut shell. </p>
